# ChannelsAndSatellites
 Search nearby channels, register users, add favorite channels, and view top providers by channels and satellites. Includes data on top rockets, channels by language and region, HD/SD status, and user-favorite channel availability



Project Overview

Implemented a comprehensive project starting with the design and creation of an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and relational models, focusing on optimizing data structure and relationships. Developed a web scraper to systematically extract structured data from a specified website and populate a SQL database. Subsequently, built a full-stack application using the MERN stack, utilizing Express.js and Node.js to create APIs for secure data transactions and business logic implementation. The frontend, developed with React, provided a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with the SQL database, ensuring efficient data flow and management.
